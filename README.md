# Event-related-trace-responses
This provides basic visualization and analysis for pre and post event related responses, specifically with analysis for fiber photometry calcium traces in mind. This script generates fake "data" (a "df/f" signal) and event times (like a stimulus time point) for you to work with. With this code you can generate a heat-map raster plot of pre and post event times to easily visualize stimulus responses, calculate the significance of each time point relative to a baseline vector, and graph your df/f traces as a mean with overlaid individual traces, SEM, and significant time points.
